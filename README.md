!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!

This is Uber fork of Phabricator Arcanist tooling and the only Arcanist version
supported by Uber's Phabricator installation. Make sure you install this version
and not upstream! Other than that you can refer to upstream documentation for help
and general guidance

Arcanist is the command-line tool for [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org).
It allows you to interact with Phabricator installs to send code for review,
download patches, transfer files, view status, make API calls, and various other
things. You can read more in the [User Guide](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist/)
